## About Me
Passionate about computer science since a young age, I enjoy building concrete projects, experimenting with ideas, and understanding how systems work under the hood.

I work on a variety of topics including software development, systems, and problem-solving, always with a hands-on approach. Several of my projects can be found below.

🎓 I’m currently a computer science student, continuously improving my skills through studies, self-learning, and personal projects.

Curious, autonomous, and motivated, I like turning ideas into clean, efficient, and functional solutions.
